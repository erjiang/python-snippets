# Python snippet #3 - Types

There are a lot of different kinds of things that we want to store and calculate in computers: numbers, text, lists of things, colors, and more.

Computers only think in terms of 1s and 0s ("bits"), but we often treat different chunks of 1s and 0s as different things.

We might say that these 8 bits should be interpreted as a number: 0001 1101

We might say that these 8 bits should be interpreted as the letter "Q": 0101 0001

From Python's perspective, it thinks of each piece of data as having a "type". Inside the computer's memory, everything is 1s and 0s, but to Python, the "type" of something affects what you can do to it and how.

Python has a few built-in types:

* `int` - integer
* `str` - string (a string of characters, text)
* `list` - a list of many values
* `set`, `dict`, `float`, and more
